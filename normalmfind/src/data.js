        "You can get it all-from organic potting soil to cherry blossom trees-and it can all be delivered at no charge the next day. It's certainly the easy way to go, but is it the best way to create a healthy garden? Big box stores with garden centers offer a huge inventory, but if you're wondering which mulch to buy or when you should plant tulips, you're pretty much on your own-staff members are scarce, and those that are there very rarely have much knowledge on the subject. There's no one to help you online either. At a local garden center, however, every salesperson more than likely has a ton of gardening knowledge pertinent to your area, and they're happy to talk mulch and planting timelines with you.",

These mobile restaurants have great built-in branding, often with menu items and fun branding painted right on the truck to help market and advertise on-the-go. Because of their traveling nature, food trucks have to be very socially savvy, using geolocation, targeting, and tags to show where they are to digital",
